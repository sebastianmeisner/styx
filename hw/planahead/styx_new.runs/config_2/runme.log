INFO:Place:1392 - 2 sites were unavailable in Reconfigurable regions during the
   placement phase because they were already used by routing of the imported
   Partitions. If the Placer is not able to find a successful solution, the
   following suggestions may help the Placer find a solution.

   1) To allow the Placer to use these sites, back off the preservation level on
   one or more of the following Partitions.  The following Partitions contain
   unavailable sites:
   	Partition /main:  2 (preserve=routing)

   NOTE: If you back off preservation on any static logic Partitions, you need
   to re-export the static logic Partitions and update all your configurations. 
   If you back off preservation on any Reconfigurable logic Partitions, you will
   need to re-export the Reconfigurable Partitions and re-generate their partial
   bitstream.

   2) Update the floorplan for the design to minimize number of excluded sites. 
   It may help to create a area of unused sites between the Reconfigurable
   Partitions.

   NOTE: If you change the floorplan for the design, all Partitions and
   configurations will have to be re-implemented.
